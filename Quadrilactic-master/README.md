## Todo List

- Tidy up codebase
	- Refactor
	- Linting
	- Component Entity System
- Pickups
- Make the title screen more exciting
- Prompt for player to start jumping
- Screenshake on bounce
- More particles (eg on bounce)
- Save volume setting to storage

## Bugs

- At very high heights, the platform will be too far below and you will drop off the bottom before it reaches you.
- Sometimes there is some weirdness that can happen due to assumed anomalous deltatime eg crazy skew.
